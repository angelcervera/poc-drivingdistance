/**
  * Low level example about how to uncompress and extract all data blocks to a folder.
  * Usually, it is not necessary to do it, but is good, for example, to extract fragments from the pbf that represent
  * data blocks and then use them to test the data block reader.
  *
  * In this example, I am writing all blocks in a folders. Rememeber that this block is a Blob, so contains
  * the string table and the possble compressed data.
